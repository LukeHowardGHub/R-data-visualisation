**Objective**

The objective of the original data set is to show the change in the number of corona virus cases over time from three different infection sources (locally, interstate and overseas). The main audience of this visualisation is residents of NSW as they would be the ones primarily concerned with the changes in the number of cases. Furthermore, concerned residents of Australia generally would also be interested in this visualisation as changes in NSW's numbers could potentially impact neighboring states.     

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* Issue 1: The main issue with this visualisation is that the number of cases for each infection source are stacked on-top of one another for each date. This makes it difficult to discern numbers for each type and draw comparisons between infection sources, especially on dates when numbers are low
* Issue 2: Another issue with this data visualisation comes from the nature of the scale on the y-axis. Combining the three infection sources means that the high case numbers from overseas infections drastically increases the scale making it very difficult to see the changes in the smaller numbers of interstate infections.
* Issue 3: The last main issue with the data visualisation is the colour choices made. The use of red and orange in the visualisation will make it potenitally difficult for people with colour blind conditions to differentiate between two of the infection sources. As this is visualisation has such a broad target audience this is a rather large oversight.

#### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(knitr)

pal <- c("#27187eff","#a188a6ff","#85c7f2ff")

CVData <- read_csv("~/Desktop/RMIT SEM 2 2020/Data Visualisation/Assignment 2/assignment2template1950/NSWCoronaVirusData.csv")
#Selecting relavent columns
CVData <- CVData %>% select(notification_date,likely_source_of_infection, lhd_2010_name)

#Changing notification date from character to date variable and factorising infection type
CVData$notification_date <-  as.Date(CVData$notification_date)
CVData$likely_source_of_infection <- CVData$likely_source_of_infection %>% as.factor()

#grouping  by date of occurance to get total number of cases for the day
CV_grp <- CVData %>% group_by(notification_date)
CV_grp_Date <- CV_grp %>% summarise(totalCases = n())

#same as above but also grouping by infection source
CV_grp_date_source <- CVData %>% group_by(notification_date, likely_source_of_infection)
CV_grp_date_source <- CV_grp_date_source %>% summarise(totalCases = n())

#Combining the different types of locally acquired into one local infection source

#Plotting data
Cases_Source <- ggplot(CV_grp_date_source, aes(x = notification_date, y = totalCases, fill = Infection_Source))

p <- p+theme(legend.position = "none",axis.text = element_text(), plot.background = element_rect(fill = background), panel.background = element_rect(fill = background2), title = element_text(face = "bold"), axis.text.x = element_text(), panel.grid = element_blank(), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), plot.caption = element_text(size = 7, face = "italic") )

p <- p+scale_fill_manual(values = pal)
